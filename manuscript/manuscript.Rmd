This manuscript uses the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science [WORCS version 0.1.1, @vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020] to ensure reproducibility and transparency. All code <!--and data--> are available at <https://github.com/taktsun/ED_ERV>.

This is an example of a non-essential citation [@@vanlissaWORCSWorkflowOpen2020]. If you change the rendering function to `worcs::cite_essential`, it will be removed.

<!--The function below inserts a notification if the manuscript is knit using synthetic data. Make sure to insert it after load_data().-->
