# Readme 

This is a folder for primary data (i.e., [anonymized but otherwise unaltered raw data](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/psychological_science/ps-submissions#data)) of my project["Naming before Taming? Emotion Differentiation and Emotion Regulation Variability Hinder Each Other within Adolescents."](https://osf.io/cq6n4/). 

Note: raw data of the two Leuven datasets can be found on EMOTE: [link 1](https://emotedatabase.com/datasets/22) and [link 2](https://emotedatabase.com/datasets/23). You can obtain primary data of these two datasets by running prepare_data.R
